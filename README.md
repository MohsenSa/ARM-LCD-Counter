# ARM-LCD-Counter

By using 2*16 LCD and STM32-Smart-v2.0 board in this project,a simple LCD counter is built.We can control the counter with the two switches by which we can increase or decrease the counter shown on the LCD.
Note : The RW pin of the LCD is directly connected to the ground (Thus there's no pre-defined pin considered in the CubeMX sketch) as we'd usaully like to write on the LCD.
