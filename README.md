# ARM-LCD-Counter

### By using 2*16 LCD and STM32-Smart-v2.0 board in this project, a simple LCD counter is built. 

We can control the counter with the two switches by which we can increase and decrease the counter shown on the LCD.

**Note:** The RW pin of the LCD is directly connected to the ground (thus there's no pre-defined pin considered in the CubeMX sketch) as we'd usaully like to write on the LCD.

### This ARM program was built with Keil and STM32Cube.
### Also you can contact me if you are in need of the whole project.
